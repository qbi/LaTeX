\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


The \emph{Monty Hall problem} is a probability puzzle, loosely based
on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after
the show's original host, \textsc{Monty Hall}. The problem was
originally posed in a letter by \textsc{Steve Selvin} to the American
Statistician in 1975 \footcite{selvin1975}, \footcite{selvin1975ii}. It became famous
in the following form, as a question from a reader's letter quoted in
\textsc{Marilyn vos Savant}'s \enquote{Ask Marilyn} column in Parade
magazine in 1990 \footcite{savant1990}:

\begin{quote}
  Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three
  doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick
  a door, say No.\,1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
  opens another door, say No.\,3, which has a goat. He then says to
  you, \enquote{Do you want to pick door No.\,2?} Is it to your
  advantage to switch your choice?
\end{quote}


\textsc{Vos Savant}'s response was that the contestant should switch to the
other door. \footcite{savant1990}

The argument depends on the assumptions, made explicit in more
extended solution descriptions given by \textsc{Selvin} \footcite{selvin1975} and by
\textsc{vos Savant} (1991a), that the host always opens a different
door from the door chosen by the player and always reveals a goat by
this action -- something he can always do because he knows where the
car is hidden. \textsc{Leonard Mlodinow} says: \enquote{The Monty Hall
  problem is hard to grasp, because unless you think about it
  carefully, the role of the host goes unappreciated.}\footcite{zbMATH05571382}

Contestants who switch have a \sfrac{2}{3} chance of winning the car,
while contestants who stick have only a \sfrac{1}{3} chance. One way
to see this is to notice that there is a \sfrac{2}{3} chance that the
initial choice of the player is a door hiding a goat. When that is the
case, the host is forced to open the other goat door, and the
remaining closed door hides the car. \enquote{Switching} only fails to
give the car when the player had initially picked the door hiding the
car, which only happens one third of the time.

Many readers of \textsc{vos Savant}'s column refused to believe that
switching is beneficial, despite her explanation of her answer. After
the problem appeared in Parade, approximately \num{10000}~readers,
including nearly \num{1000} with PhDs, wrote to the magazine claiming
that \textsc{vos Savant} was wrong (Tierney 1991). Even when given
explanations, simulations, and formal mathematical proofs, many people
still do not accept that switching is the best strategy. (vos Savant
1991a) \textsc{Paul Erdős}, one of the most prolific mathematicians in
history, remained unconvinced until he was shown a computer simulation
confirming the predicted result (Vazsonyi 1999).

The Monty Hall problem has attracted academic interest because the
result is surprising and the problem is simple to
formulate. Furthermore, variations of the Monty Hall problem can
easily be made by changing the implied assumptions, and the variations
can have drastically different consequences. For example, if Monty
only offers the contestant a chance to switch when the contestant has
initially chosen the car, then the contestant should never switch. If
Monty opens another door at random and only happens to reveal a goat,
then it makes no difference.

The problem is a paradox of the veridical type, because the correct
result (you should switch doors) is at first sight ludicrous, but is
nevertheless demonstrably true. It is mathematically closely related
to the earlier Three Prisoners problem, and both problems bear some
similarity to the much older Bertrand's box paradox.

\chapter{The paradox}
\label{sec:paradox}



The most well known statement of the problem is:

\begin{quote}
  Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three
  doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick
  a door, say No.\,1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
  opens another door, say No.\, 3, which has a goat. He then says to
  you, \enquote{Do you want to pick door No.\,2?} Is it to your
  advantage to switch your choice?
  \hfill{(Whitaker, 1990, as quoted by vos Savant \footcite{savant1990})}
\end{quote}


\textsc{Vos Savant}'s response was:

\begin{quote}
  Yes; you should switch. The first door has a \sfrac{1}{3} chance of
  winning, but the second door has a \sfrac{2}{3} chance. Here’s a
  good way to visualize what happened. Suppose there are a million
  doors, and you pick door \#1. Then the host, who knows what’s behind
  the doors and will always avoid the one with the prize, opens them
  all except door \#777,777. You’d switch to that door pretty fast,
  wouldn’t you?
\end{quote}


You should swap, and doing so gives you a \sfrac{2}{3} chance of
winning the car. A simple explanation is that players initially have a
\sfrac{2}{3} chance of picking a goat and those who swap always get
the opposite of their original choice. So players who always swap have
a \sfrac{2}{3} chance of getting the car (Carlton 2005).

\textsc{Leonard Mlodinow} says, \enquote{The Monty Hall problem is
  hard to grasp, because unless you think about it carefully, the role
  of the host goes unappreciated.}\footcite{zbMATH05571382} The correct answer,
that players who swap have a \sfrac{2}{3} chance of winning the car
and players who stick have a \sfrac{1}{3} chance of winning the car,
is based on the premise that the host knows which door hides the car
and will always reveal a goat but never the car. If the player
initially selected the door that hides the car (a 1-in-3 chance only),
then both remaining doors hide goats, the host may choose either door,
and switching doors loses. On the other hand, if the player initially
selected a door that hides a goat (a 2-in-3 chance), then the host has
no choice but to show the other goat, and switching door wins for
sure.

If the host however, contradictory to the premise of the standard
paradox, had opened a door at random and revealed a goat simply by
chance, then the odds staying:switching would have been reduced from
1:2 as per the paradox to 1:1 only, as per the common intuitive wrong
answer, because half of the potential winning cases are wasted when
the host can accidentally reveal also the car (Rosenthal, 2005a),
(Rosenthal, 2005b).  

\chapter{Origin and full assumptions}
\label{sec:orig-full-assumpt}


\textsc{Steve Selvin} wrote a letter to the American Statistician in
1975 describing a problem loosely based on the game show Let's Make a
Deal. \footcite{selvin1975} In a subsequent letter he dubbed it the
\enquote{Monty Hall problem}. \footcite{selvin1975ii} The problem is
mathematically equivalent to the Three Prisoners Problem described in
\textsc{Martin Gardner}'s \enquote{Mathematical Games} column in
Scientific American in 1959 (Gardner 1959a) and the Three Shells
Problem described in Gardner's book \enquote{Aha Gotcha} (Gardner
1982). (Morgan et al., 1991) In 1990 the same problem was famously
restated in the form shown above in a letter by \textsc{Craig
  Whitaker} to \textsc{Marilyn vos Savant}'s \enquote{Ask Marilyn}
column in Parade.

There are ambiguities in \textsc{Craig Whitaker}'s quoted description
of how the game is played: the description does not make explicit that
the host must always open one of the two other doors, that opening the
other door always reveals a goat, and that the host always offers the
player the opportunity to switch doors. However \textsc{Marilyn vos
  Savant}'s \footcite{savant1990} solution, printed alongside \textsc{Whitaker}'s
question, does make quite clear that this is her intended
interpretation of the problem. (Mueser and Granberg 1999) The standard
understanding of the Monty Hall problem, written out explicitly both
by \textsc{Selvin} \footcite{selvin1975} and \textsc{vos Savant} (1991a), is that
the host must always open an unchosen door that reveals a goat and
make the offer to switch.

Very often it is also assumed that the car is initially hidden
completely at random, and that if the host has a choice of door to
open (which happens if the player initially picked the car) then this
choice is completely random, too. (Krauss and Wang, 2003:9) Some
authors, either instead of or together with these probability
assumptions, assume that the player's initial choice is completely
random, for instance. \footcite{selvin1975}

\chapter{Vos Savant and the media furor}
\label{sec:vos-savant-media}

\textsc{Vos Savant} wrote in her first column on the Monty Hall
problem that the player should switch, saying that the first door has
a \sfrac{1}{3} chance of winning, hence the second door offered to
switch to has a \sfrac{2}{3} chance as the host always opens a losing
door on purpose. \footcite{savant1990} She went on to explain her answer
by asking the reader to visualize the case where there are a million
doors and the player picks \#1. Then the host, who knows what’s behind
the doors and will always avoid the one with the prize, opens all
remaining doors except door \#777,777. Her conclusion: \enquote{You’d
  switch to that door pretty fast, wouldn’t you?}

In response to her answer, \textsc{vos Savant} received thousands of
letters from her readers, many with PhDs, telling her that she was
wrong. Of the letters from the general public, 92\,\% were against her
answer, and of the letters from universities, 65\,\% were against her
answer. During 1990--1991 three more of her columns in Parade magazine
were devoted to her debate with her readers (vos Savant 1990–1991),
and the debate was also replayed in other venues (e.g., in
\textsc{Cecil Adams} popular \enquote{The Straight Dope} newspaper
column, Adams, 1990) and reported on in major newspapers such as the
New York Times (Tierney, 1991).

\textsc{Vos Savant} replied with further explanation, \enquote{The
  winning odds of \sfrac{1}{3} on the first choice can’t go up to
  \sfrac{1}{2} just because the host opens a losing door,} and she
proposed a shell game (Gardner 1982) to illustrate her thinking:
\enquote{You look away, and I put a pea under one of three
  shells. Then I ask you to put your finger on a shell. The odds that
  your choice contains a pea are \sfrac{1}{3}, agreed? Then I simply
  lift up an empty shell from the remaining other two. As I can (and
  will) do this regardless of what you’ve chosen, we’ve learned
  nothing to allow us to revise the odds on the shell under your
  finger.} She also proposed a similar simulation of the game with
three playing cards.

Even after her further explanations, readers continued to write in
telling her that she was wrong. Nevertheless, people did begin to
change their minds about the solution. Of those that actually carried
out \textsc{vos Savant}'s shell simulation, nearly 100\,\% wrote to
say that they agreed with her. Of the general public, about 56\,\%
came to believe that switching was best; and of academic institutions,
71\,\%.

\textsc{Vos Savant} commented that though some confusion was caused by
some readers not realizing that they were supposed to assume that the
host must always reveal a goat, still, almost all of her numerous
correspondents had correctly understood the problem assumptions, and
despite this were initially convinced that Marylin's answer
(\enquote{switch}) was wrong.

\section{The little green woman}
\label{sec:little-green-woman}


To help explain why people thought that the probability of winning
both sticking and switching was equal, \textsc{vos Savant} asked
readers to consider the case where a little green woman emerges on
stage from a UFO at the point that the player has to decide whether or
not to switch, and the host asks the little green woman to point to
one of the two unopened doorsdoors. In that case, \textsc{vos Savant}
points out, the chances that she’ll randomly choose the door with the
prize are \sfrac{1}{2}, but that is because she lacks the information
that the player has, knowing which door he/she had initially chosen
and which one had been offered by the host to switch on.

\section{A second controversy}
\label{sec:second-controversy}


Four university professors published an article (Morgan et al, 1991)
in The American Statistician in which it was claimed that though
\textsc{vos Savant} gave the correct advice (to switch), her argument
for this advice was completely wrong. In their opinion the question
asks for the chance that the car is behind door~2 given that the
player chose door~1 and the host opened door~3. \textsc{Morgan} et
al. showed that this chance could be anything between \sfrac{1}{2} and
1, depending on how the host chooses a door to open when he has a
choice. Only when he chooses completely at random is the chance
\sfrac{2}{3}.

In an invited comment (Seymann, 1991) and in subsequent letters to the
editor, (vos Savant, 1991c; Rao, 1992; Bell, 1992; Hogbin and Nijdam,
2011) \textsc{Morgan} et al. were supported by some writers,
criticized by others; in each case a response by \textsc{Morgan} et
al. is published alongside the letter or comment in The American
Statistician. In particular, \textsc{vos Savant} defended herself
vigorously. \textsc{Morgan} et al. complained in their response to
\textsc{vos Savant} (1991c) that \textsc{vos Savant} still had not
actually responded to their own main point. Later in their response to
\textsc{Hogbin} and \textsc{Nijdam} (2011) they did agree that it was
natural to suppose that the host chooses a door to open completely at
random, when he does have a choice, and hence that the conditional
probability of winning by switching (i.\,e., conditional given the
situation the player is in when he has to make his choice) has the
same value, \sfrac{2}{3}, as the unconditional probability of winning
by switching (i.\,e., averaged over all possible situations). This
equality was already emphasized by Bell (1992) who suggested that
\textsc{Morgan} et al.'s mathematically involved solution would only
appeal to statisticians, whereas the equivalence of the conditional
and unconditional solutions in the case of symmetry was intuitively
obvious.

\chapter{Solutions}
\label{sec:solutions}


\section{Vos Savant}
\label{sec:vos-savant}

The solution presented by \textsc{vos Savant} (1990b) in Parade shows
the three possible arrangements of one car and two goats behind three
doors and the result of staying or switching after initially picking
door~1 in each case:


\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \toprule
    \textbf{behind} &  \textbf{behind } &  \textbf{behind} & \textbf{result if staying} & \textbf{result if switching}\\
    \textbf{ door 1} &\textbf{door 2} &\textbf{ door 3} & \textbf{ at door \#1} & \textbf{ to the door offered
    }\\
    \midrule
    \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} &  Goat\\
    \midrule

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Possible arragements of one car and two goats}
  \label{tab:arrange-car-goat}
\end{table}


A player who stays with the initial choice wins in only one out of
three of these equally likely possibilities, while a player who
switches wins in two out of three. The probability of winning by
staying with the initial choice is therefore \sfrac{1}{3}, while the
probability of winning by switching is \sfrac{2}{3}.

\section{Carlton}
\label{sec:carlton}

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.54\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{Monty-closed-doors}
  \end{center}
  \caption{Player's pick has a \sfrac{1}{3}~chance on the car and
    \sfrac{2}{3}~chance on a goat. As each one has \sfrac{1}{3}~chance
    on the car, the combined chance of door~2 and door~3 hiding the
    car is \sfrac{2}{3}.}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.25\textwidth]{Monty-open-door-chances}
  \end{center}
  \caption{With the usual assumptions, after the host deliberately
    opened a door to intentionally show a goat, but without any
    further information, the player's pick still retains its
    \sfrac{1}{3}~chance, likewise the other two doors still retain
    their combined \sfrac{2}{3}~chance:
    Null for the door opened, but \sfrac{2}{3} for the host's second
    still unopened door.}
\end{wrapfigure}
An intuitive explanation is to reason that players whose strategy is
to switch lose if and only if they initially pick the car; that
happens with probability \sfrac{1}{3}, so switching must win with
probability \sfrac{2}{3} (Carlton 2005, concluding remarks).

Simply put, if the contestant picks a goat (to which two of the three
doors lead) the contestant will win the car by switching as the other
goat can no longer be picked, while if the contestant picks the car
(to which one door leads) the contestant will not win the car by
switching. So, if contestants switch, they will win the car if they
originally picked a goat and they will not win if they originally
picked the car. As they have a 2 in 3 chance of originally picking a
goat, they have a 2 in 3 chance of winning by switching.

\section{Adams and Devlin}
\label{sec:adams-devlin}

Another way to understand the solution is to consider the two original
unchosen doors together. Instead of one door being opened and shown to
be a losing door, an equivalent action is to combine the two unchosen
doors into one since the player cannot choose the opened door (Adams
1990; Devlin 2003; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008).

As \textsc{Cecil Adams} puts it (Adams 1990), \enquote{Monty is saying
  in effect: you can keep your one door or you can have the other two
  doors}. The player therefore has the choice of either sticking with
the original choice of door, or choosing the sum of the contents of
the two other doors. The \sfrac{2}{3} chance of hiding the car has not
been changed by the opening of one of these doors because Monty,
knowing the location of the car, is equally likely to reveal a goat
whether the player originally picked the car or the goat (in fact: in
both cases, he is certain to do so). If the host did not know where
the car is hidden, but opened a door revealing a goat by chance, the
revelation would indeed change the probability of the player's
original choice being correct to \sfrac{1}{2}. The critical difference
is that an ignorant host is more likely to successfully reveal a goat
when the player's original choice is the car than he is when the
original choice is a goat, so the revealing of a goat by chance does
provide evidence in favor of the player's original choice winning the
car.

In other words, offering the player to switch doors after revealing a
goat is no different than if the host offered the player to switch
from their original chosen door to both remaining doors, and only
after the player chooses, the host shows that one of the two doors
contains a goat (which at least one always will). The switch in this
case clearly gives the player a \sfrac{2}{3}~probability of chosing
the car, and the revealation that a goat is behind one of the player's
two doors, which is always the case, does not change this probability.

As \textsc{Keith Devlin} says (Devlin 2003), \enquote{By opening his
  door, Monty is saying to the contestant \enquote{There are two doors
    you did not choose, and the probability that the prize is behind
    one of them is \sfrac{2}{3}. I'll help you by using my knowledge
    of where the prize is to open one of those two doors to show you
    that it does not hide the prize. You can now take advantage of
    this additional information. Your choice of door A has a chance of
    1 in 3 of being the winner. I have not changed that. But by
    eliminating door C, I have shown you that the probability that
    door B hides the prize is 2 in 3.}}

\section{  Vos Savant -- Increasing the number of doors}
\label{sec:vos-savant-incr}

That switching has a probability of \sfrac{2}{3} of winning the car
runs counter to many people's intuition. If there are two doors left,
then why is each door not \sfrac{1}{2}? It may be easier to appreciate
the solution by considering the same problem with \num{1000000}~doors
instead of just three. \footcite{savant1990} In this case there are
\num{999999}~doors with goats behind them and one door with a
prize. The player picks a door. His initial probability of winning is
1 out of \num{1000000}. The game host goes down the line of doors,
opening each one to show \num{999998}~goats in total, skipping over
only the player's door and one other door. The host then offers the
player the chance to switch to the only other unopened door. On
average, in \num{999999} out of \num{1000000}~times the other door
will contain the prize, as \num{999999} out of \num{1000000}~times the
player first picked a door with a goat -- the chance that the player's
door is correct has not changed.  A rational player should switch.

Intuitively speaking, the player should ask how likely is it, that
given a million doors, he or she managed to pick the right one. It's
as if Monty gives you the chance to keep your one door, or open all
\num{999999} of the other doors, of which he kindly opens \num{999998}
for you, leaving, deliberately, the one with the prize. Clearly, one
would choose to open the other \num{999999} doors rather than keep the
one.

\textsc{Stibel} et al. (2008) proposed working memory demand is taxed
during the Monty Hall problem and that this forces people to
\enquote{collapse} their choices into two equally probable
options. They report that when increasing the number of options to
over 7~choices (7~doors) people tend to switch more often; however
most still incorrectly judge the probability of success at
\sfrac{50}{50}.

\section{'The Economist'}
\label{sec:the-economist}


In this analysis the words, \enquote{say No.\,1}, and \enquote{say
  No.\,3} in the question are not taken to mean that we are only to
consider the case where the player has chosen door~1 and the host has
revealed a goat behind door~3. The problem is solved by considering
the equally likely events that the player has initially chosen the
car, goat~A, or goat~B (Economist 1999). In the first case, switching
doors loses, but in the other two cases, switching doors wins, see
\autoref{fig:curlypicksgoat}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.7\textwidth]{Monty-CurlyPicksCar}
  \caption{The player has an equal chance of initially selecting the car, Goat A, or Goat B. Switching results in a win \sfrac{2}{3} of the time.}
  \label{fig:curlypicksgoat}
\end{figure}

\section{Simulations}
\label{sec:simulations}

A simple way to demonstrate that a switching strategy really does win
two out of three times on the average is to simulate the game with
playing cards (Gardner 1959b; vos Savant 1996, p. 8). Three cards from
an ordinary deck are used to represent the three doors; one
\enquote{special} card such as the Ace of Spades should represent the
door with the car, and ordinary cards, such as the two red twos,
represent the goat doors.

\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{.4\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth]{Monty-problem-monte-carlo}
  \end{center}
\caption{Simulation of 30 outcomes of the Monty Hall problem}
\end{wrapfigure}
The simulation, using the following procedure, can be repeated several
times to simulate multiple rounds of the game. One card is dealt
face-down at random to the \enquote{player}, to represent the door the
player picks initially. Then, looking at the remaining two cards, at
least one of which must be a red two, the \enquote{host} discards a
red two. If the card remaining in the host's hand is the Ace of
Spades, this is recorded as a round where the player would have won by
switching; if the host is holding a red two, the round is recorded as
one where staying would have won.

As this experiment is repeated over several rounds, the observed win
rate for each strategy is likely to approximate its theoretical win
probability. Repeated plays also make it clearer why switching is the
better strategy. After one card has been dealt to the player, it is
already determined whether switching will win the round for the
player; and two times out of three the Ace of Spades is in the host's
hand.

If this is not convincing, the simulation can be done with the entire
deck, dealing one card to the player and keeping the other 51 (Gardner
1959b; Adams 1990). In this variant the Ace of Spades goes to the host
51~times out of 52, and stays with the host no matter how many non-Ace
cards are discarded.

Another simulation, suggested by \textsc{vos Savant}, employs the
\enquote{host} hiding a penny, representing the car, under one of
three cups, representing the doors; or hiding a pea under one of three
shells.

\section{Solutions using conditional probability}
\label{sec:solut-using-cond}


The player is only asked whether or not he would like to switch after
the host has opened a particular door, different from the player's
initial choice, and revealed a goat behind it. In order to be sure of
having the best possible chance of getting the car, the player should
clearly make his decision of whether or not to switch on the basis of
the probability that the car is behind the other closed door, given
all the information which he has at this moment. That information
consists, in the example given by \textsc{Marilyn vos Savant}, of the
fact that it was door~1 which was initially chosen by himself, and
that it was door~3 which was opened by the host to reveal a goat.

\subsection{Refining the simple solution}
\label{sec:refin-simple-solut}


Given the player's initial choice, door~1, the host might also have
opened door~2 to reveal a goat. Suppose we assume that the host is
equally likely to open either door~2 or 3 if the car is behind
door~1. We already assumed that the car is equally likely behind any
of the three doors, and this remains so after the player has made his
initial choice. It follows that the probability the car is behind
door~1 given the host opens door~3 and the player initially chose
door~1 must equal the probability that the car is behind door~1 given
the host opens door~2 and the player initially chose door~1, since all
elementary probabilities in the problem (probabilities of locations of
car given the player initially chose door~1, and probabilities of
which door the host will open if car is behind door~1, the door chosen
by the player) are unchanged by interchanging the door numbers 2 and
3.

In other words, given that the player initially chose door~1, whether
the host opens door~2 or door~3 gives us no information at all as to
whether or not the car is behind door~1.

In the simple solutions, we already observed that the probability that
the car is behind door~1, the door initially chosen by the player, is
initially \sfrac{1}{3}. Moreover, the host is certainly going to open
a (different) door to reveal a goat, so opening a door (which door,
door~2 or door~3, unspecified) does not change this probability. This
probability, \sfrac{1}{3}, must be the average of the probability that
the car is behind door~1, given the host opens door~2 and the player
chose door~1, and the probability that the car is behind door~1, given
the host opens door~3 and the player chose door~1, because these are
the only two possibilities. But these two probabilities are the
same. Therefore they are both equal to \sfrac{1}{3}.

This more refined analysis (which can be found in the published
discussion following the paper of \textsc{Morgan} et al. 1991) shows
that the chance that the car is behind door~1 given that the player
initially chose this door and given that the host opened door~3 is
\sfrac{1}{3}, and it follows that the chance that the car is behind
door~2 given the player initially chose door~1 and the host opened
door~3 is \sfrac{2}{3}. The analysis also shows that the overall
success rate of \sfrac{2}{3}, achieved by always switching, cannot be
improved, and underlines what already may well have been intuitively
obvious: the choice facing the player is that between the door
initially chosen, and the other door left closed by the host: the
specific numbers on these doors are irrelevant.

\subsection{Conditional probability by direct calculation}
\label{sec:cond-prob-direct}


Most sources in the field of probability, including many introductory
probability textbooks, solve the Monty Hall problem by showing from
first principles that the conditional probabilities the car is behind
door~1 and door~2 are \sfrac{1}{3} and \sfrac{2}{3} (not \sfrac{1}{2}
and \sfrac{1}{2}) given the contestant initially picks door~1 and the
host opens door~3 (\footcite{selvin1975ii}, Morgan et al. 1991, Chun 1991,
Gillman 1992, Carlton 2005, Grinstead and Snell 2006:137–138, Lucas et
al. 2009). In contrast, the simple solutions above show that a player
with a strategy of switching wins the car with overall probability
\sfrac{2}{3}, i.\,e., without taking account of which door was opened
by the host (Grinstead and Snell 2006:137–138 Carlton 2005). For
example, if we imagine 300~repetitions of the show, in all of which
the player initially chooses door~1, a strategy of \enquote{always
  switching} will win about 200~times -- namely every time the car is
not behind door~1. The solutions in this section consider just those
cases in which not only the player picked door~1, but moreover the
host went on to open door~3. After all, it is only after a door was
opened to reveal a goat that the player was asked if he wants to
switch or not. Of our total of 300~repetitions, door~3 will be opened
by the host about 150~times: the other 150~times the host will open
door~2. The following solutions show that when we restrict attention
to the first mentioned 150~cases (player initially picked door~1, host
went on to reveal a goat behind door~3), the car will be behind door~2
about 100 times, but behind door 1 only about 50~times.

By definition, the conditional probability of winning by switching
given the contestant initially picks door~1 and the host opens door~3
is the probability the car is behind door~2 and the host opens door~3
divided by the probability the host opens door~3. These probabilities
can be determined referring to the conditional probability table
below, or to an equivalent decision tree as shown to the right (Chun
1991; Carlton 2005; Grinstead and Snell 2006:137–138).

Assuming the player picks door~1, the car is behind door~2 and the
host opens door~3 with probability \sfrac{1}{3}. The car is behind
door~1 and the host opens door~3 with probability \sfrac{1}{6}. These
are the only possibilities given the player picks door~1 and the host
opens door~3. Therefore, the conditional probability of winning by
switching is \sfrac{\sfrac{1}{3}}{(\sfrac{1}{3} + \sfrac{1}{6})}, which is
\sfrac{2}{3} \footcite{selvin1975ii}.

The conditional probability table in \autoref{sec:cond-prob-table-1}
shows how 300~cases, in all of which the player initially chooses
door~1, would be split up, on average, according to the location of
the car and the choice of door to open by the host.


\subsection{Extension of vos Savant's table}
\label{sec:extens-vos-savants}



An equivalent way to present this approach (Rosenhouse, 2009; Krauss
and Wang, 2003) is by extending \textsc{vos Savant}'s table
(\autoref{sec:cond-prob-table-1}), where it is given that the player has
chosen door~1. \autoref{tab:cond-prob-with-prob} shows it is with
probabilities included:

\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \toprule
    \textsc{case} & \textsc{Prob.} & \textsc{behind} &
    \textsc{behind} & \textsc{behind} & \textsc{result} & \textsc{result}\\
    & & \textsc{door 1} & \textsc{door 2} & \textsc{door 3} &
    \textsc{if staying} & \textsc{if switching}\\
    \midrule
    1 & \sfrac{1}{3} & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} & Goat\\
    \midrule
    2 & \sfrac{1}{3} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
    \midrule
    3 & \sfrac{1}{3} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} &Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Conditional probability table with probabilities included}
  \label{tab:cond-prob-with-prob}
\end{table}

Next we expand row~1 according to the host's behaviour - if he has a
choice, into two equally likely subcases 1a and 1b
(\autoref{tab:cond-prob-with-prob-1a-1b}):

\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \toprule
    \textsc{case} & \textsc{Prob.} & \textsc{behind} &
    \textsc{behind} & \textsc{behind} & \textsc{opened} & \textsc{result} & \textsc{result}\\
    & & \textsc{door 1} & \textsc{door 2} & \textsc{door 3} &
    \textsc{door} &
    \textsc{if staying} & \textsc{if switching}\\
    \midrule
    1a & \sfrac{1}{6} & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & 2 & \textbf{Car} &  Goat\\
    \midrule
    1b & \sfrac{1}{6} & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{3} & \textbf{Car} &  Goat\\
    \midrule
    2 & \sfrac{1}{3} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} & Goat & \textbf{3} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
    \midrule
    3 & \sfrac{1}{3} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} & 2 &Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Conditional probability table with probabilities included}
  \label{tab:cond-prob-with-prob-1a-1b}
\end{table}

Finally we expand the remaining rows, too; imagine a fair coin being
tossed to separate each outcome of probability \sfrac{1}{3} into two
outcomes of probability \sfrac{1}{6}. This splits case~2 into two
equally likely subcases~2a and 2b, and case~3 into two equally likely
subcases~3a and 3b (\autoref{tab:cond-prob-with-prob-1a-1b-2-3}):

\begin{table}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \toprule
    \textsc{case} & \textsc{Prob.} & \textsc{behind} &
    \textsc{behind} & \textsc{behind} & \textsc{opened} & \textsc{result} & \textsc{result}\\
    & & \textsc{door 1} & \textsc{door 2} & \textsc{door 3} &
    \textsc{door} &
    \textsc{if staying} & \textsc{if switching}\\
    \midrule
    1a & \sfrac{1}{6} & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & 2 & \textbf{Car} &  Goat\\
    \midrule
    1b & \sfrac{1}{6} & \textbf{Car} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{3} & \textbf{Car} &  Goat\\
    \midrule
    2a & \sfrac{1}{6} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} & Goat & \textbf{3} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
    \midrule
    2b & \sfrac{1}{6} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} & Goat & \textbf{3} & Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
    \midrule
    3a & \sfrac{1}{6} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} & 2 &Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
    \midrule
    3b & \sfrac{1}{6} & Goat & Goat & \textbf{Car} & 2 &Goat  & \textbf{Car} \\
\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Conditional probability table with probabilities included}
  \label{tab:cond-prob-with-prob-1a-1b-2-3}
\end{table}



Now we have six equally likely cases, and can compute probabilities
and conditional probabilities simply by counting. In three of the six
equally likely cases, the host opens door~3. In two of those three
cases, the car is behind door~2. Therefore the conditional probability
of winning by switching given the host opened door~3 (and the player
initially chose door 1) is \sfrac{2}{3}.

\subsection{Bayes' theorem}


Many probability text books and articles in the field of probability
theory (and the teaching of probability theory) derive the conditional
probability solution through a formal application of \textsc{Bayes}'
theorem; among them Gill, 2002 and Henze, 1997. Use of the odds form
of \textsc{Bayes}' theorem, often called \textsc{Bayes}' rule, makes
such a derivation more transparent (Rosenthal, 2005a), (Rosenthal,
2005b).

Initially, the car is equally likely behind any of the three doors:
the odds on door~1, door~2, and door~3 are $1\colon1\colon1$. This
remains the case after the player has chosen door~1, by
independence. According to \textsc{Bayes}' rule, the posterior odds on
the location of the car, given the host opens door~3, are equal to the
prior odds multiplied by the \textsc{Bayes} factor or likelihood,
which is by definition the probability of the new piece of information
(host opens door~3) under each of the hypotheses considered (location
of the car). Now, since the player initially chose door~1, the chance
the host opens door~3 is 50\,\% if the car is behind door~1, 100\,\%
if the car is behind door~2, 0\,\% if the car is behind door~3. Thus
the \textsc{Bayes} factor consists of the ratios $\sfrac{1}{2}\colon
1\colon 0$ or equivalently $1\colon2\colon 0$, while the prior odds
were $1\colon 1\colon 1$. Thus the posterior odds become equal to the
\textsc{Bayes} factor $1\colon 2\colon 0$. Given the host opened
door~3, the probability the car is behind door~3 is zero, and it is
twice more likely to be behind door~2 than door~1.

\textsc{Richard Gill} (2011) uses a similar argument to patch a
missing step in \textsc{Devlin}'s combined doors solution (Devlin
2003), described above (\enquote{Adams and Devlin}). \textsc{Devlin}
does not explain why the information of which door had been opened by
the host did not change the odds on door~1 hiding the car. The
contestant is not just given the opportunity to choose between door~1
and doors~2 plus 3 -- he is also told something specific about those
two doors (\enquote{no car behind door 3}). Correspondents pointed out
this missing step to \textsc{Devlin} and he later (Devlin 2005)
retracted his \enquote{combined doors} solution, giving a direct
calculation using \textsc{Bayes} theorem instead, saying that though
unintuitive, it did at least give one the guarantee of obtaining the
right answer in an automatic way.

The justification provided by \textsc{Gill} is as follows. Given the
car is not behind door~1 (the door initially chosen by the
contestant), it is equally likely that it is behind door~2 or
door~3. In those cases, the host is forced to open the other
door. Therefore, the chance that the host opens door 3 given that the
car is not behind door~1 is 50\,\%. Given the car is behind door~1 the
chance that the host opens door~3 is also 50\,\%, because when the
host has a choice, either choice is equally likely. Therefore, whether
or not the car is behind door~1, the chance the host opens door~3 is
50\,\%. The information \enquote{host opens door~3} contributes a
Bayes factor or likelihood ratio of $50\colon 50$, or $1\colon 1$,
concerning the question whether or not the car is behind
door~1. Initially, the odds against door~1 hiding the car were
$2\colon 1$. Therefore the posterior odds against door~1 hiding the
car remain the same as the prior odds, $2\colon1$.

In words, the information which door is opened by the host (door~2 or
door~3?) reveals no information at all about whether or not the car is
behind door~1, and this is precisely what is alleged to be intuitively
obvious by supporters of simple solutions, or using the idioms of
mathematical proofs, \enquote{obviously true, by symmetry} (Bell
1992).

\section{Strategic dominance solution}
\label{sec:strat-domin-solut}

Going back to \textsc{Nalebuff} (1987), the Monty Hall problem is also
much studied in the literature on game theory and decision theory, and
also some popular solutions (for instance, that were published in The
Economist, see above, among the simple solutions) correspond to this
point of view. \textsc{Vos Savant} asks for a decision, not a
chance. And the chance aspects of how the car is hidden and how an
unchosen door is opened are unknown. From this point of view, one has
to remember that the player has two opportunities to make choices:
first of all, which door to choose initially; and secondly, whether or
not to switch. Since he does not know how the car is hidden nor how
the host makes choices, he may be able to make use of his first choice
opportunity, as it were to neutralize the actions of the team running
the quiz show, including the host.

Following \textsc{Gill}, 2011 a strategy of contestant involves two
actions: the initial choice of a door and the decision to switch (or
to stick) which may depend on both the door initially chosen and the
door to which the host offers switching. For instance, one
contestant's strategy is \enquote{choose door 1, then switch to door 2
  when offered, and do not switch to door 3 when offered.} Twelve such
deterministic strategies of the contestant exist.

Elementary comparison of contestant's strategies shows that for every
strategy~$A$ there is another strategy~$B$ \enquote{pick a door then
  switch no matter what happens} which dominates it (Gnedin, 2011). No
matter how the car is hidden and no matter which rule the host uses
when he has a choice between two goats, if $A$ wins the car then $B$
also does. For example, strategy~$A$ \enquote{pick door 1 then always
  stick with it} is dominated by the strategy~$B$ \enquote{pick door 2
  then always switch after the host reveals a door}: $A$ wins when
door~1 conceals the car, while $B$ wins when one of the doors~1 and 3
conceals the car. Similarly, strategy~$A$ \enquote{pick door~1 then
  switch to door~2 (if offered), but do not switch to door~3 (if
  offered)} is dominated by strategy~$B$ \enquote{pick door 3 then
  always switch}.

Dominance is a strong reason to seek for a solution among
always-switching strategies, under fairly general assumptions on the
environment in which the contestant is making decisions. In
particular, if the car is hidden by means of some randomization device
-- like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die -- the
dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of
winning the car will be among three always-switching strategies,
namely it will be the strategy which initially picks the least likely
door then switches no matter which door to switch is offered by the
host.

Strategic dominance links the Monty Hall problem to the game
theory. In the zero-sum game setting of Gill, 2011, discarding the
nonswitching strategies reduces the game to the following simple
variant: the host (or the TV-team) decides on the door to hide the
car, and the contestant chooses two doors (i.\,e., the two doors
remaining after the player's first, nominal, choice). The contestant
wins (and her opponent loses) if the car is behind one of the two
doors she chose.

\chapter{Confusion and criticism}
\label{sec:confusion-criticism}


\section{Sources of confusion}
\label{sec:sources-confusion}



When first presented with the Monty Hall problem an overwhelming
majority of people assume that each door has an equal probability and
conclude that switching does not matter (Mueser and Granberg,
1999). Out of 228~subjects in one study, only 13\,\% chose to switch
(Granberg and Brown, 1995:713). In her book The Power of Logical
Thinking, \textsc{vos Savant} (1996, p. 15) quotes cognitive
psychologist \textsc{Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini} as saying
\enquote{\dots{} other statistical puzzle comes so close to fooling
  all the people all the time} and \enquote{that even Nobel physicists
  systematically give the wrong answer, and that they insist on it,
  and they are ready to berate in print those who propose the right
  answer.} Interestingly, pigeons make mistakes and learn from
mistakes, and experiments show that they rapidly learn to always
switch, unlike humans (Herbranson and Schroeder, 2010).

Most statements of the problem, notably the one in Parade Magazine, do
not match the rules of the actual game show (Krauss and Wang, 2003:9),
and do not fully specify the host's behavior or that the car's
location is randomly selected (Granberg and Brown,
1995:712). \textsc{Krauss} and \textsc{Wang} (2003:10) conjecture that
people make the standard assumptions even if they are not explicitly
stated. (From the point of view of subjective probability, the
standard assumptions can be derived from the problem statement: they
follow from our total lack of information about how the car is hidden,
how the player initially chooses a door, and how the host chooses a
door to open if there's a choice.)

Although these issues are mathematically significant, even when
controlling for these factors nearly all people still think each of
the two unopened doors has an equal probability and conclude switching
does not matter (Mueser and Granberg, 1999). This \enquote{equal
  probability} assumption is a deeply rooted intuition (Falk
1992:202). People strongly tend to think probability is evenly
distributed across as many unknowns as are present, whether it is or
not (Fox and Levav, 2004:637). Indeed, if a player believes that
sticking and switching are equally successful and therefore equally
often decides to switch as to stay, they will win 50\,\% of the time,
reinforcing their original belief. Missing the unequal chances of
those two doors, and in not considering that
\sfrac{\sfrac{1}{3}+\sfrac{2}{3}}{2} gives a chance of 50\,\%, similar
to \enquote{the little green woman} example (Marc C. Steinbach, 2000).

The problem continues to attract the attention of cognitive
psychologists. The typical behaviour of the majority, i.\,e., not
switching, may be explained by phenomena known in the psychological
literature as:
\begin{inparaenum}
\item the endowment effect (Kahneman et al., 1991); people
tend to overvalue the winning probability of the already chosen –
already \enquote{owned} – door;
\item the status quo bias (Samuelson and
Zeckhauser, 1988);
\end{inparaenum}
people prefer to stick with the choice of door they have already
made. Experimental evidence confirms that these are plausible
explanations which do not depend on probability intuition (Morone and
Fiore, 2007).

\section{Criticism of the simple solutions}
\label{sec:crit-simple-solut}


As already remarked, most sources in the field of probability,
including many introductory probability textbooks, solve the problem
by showing the conditional probabilities the car is behind door~1 and
door~2 are \sfrac{1}{3} and \sfrac{2}{3} (not \sfrac{1}{2} and
\sfrac{1}{2}) given the contestant initially picks door~1 and the host
opens door~3; various ways to derive and understand this result were
given in the previous subsections. Among these sources are several
that explicitly criticize the popularly presented \enquote{simple}
solutions, saying these solutions are \enquote{correct but ... shaky}
(Rosenthal 2005a), or do not \enquote{address the problem posed}
(Gillman 1992), or are \enquote{incomplete} (Lucas et al. 2009), or
are \enquote{unconvincing and misleading} (Eisenhauer 2001) or are
(most bluntly) \enquote{false} (Morgan et al. 1991). Some say that
these solutions answer a slightly different question – one phrasing is
\enquote{you have to announce before a door has been opened whether
  you plan to switch} (Gillman 1992, emphasis in the original).

The simple solutions show in various ways that a contestant who is
determined to switch will win the car with probability \sfrac{2}{3},
and hence that switching is the winning strategy, if the player has to
choose in advance between \enquote{always switching}, and
\enquote{always staying}. However, the probability of winning by
always switching is a logically distinct concept from the probability
of winning by switching given the player has picked door~1 and the
host has opened door~3. As one source says, \enquote{the distinction
  between [these questions] seems to confound many} (Morgan et
al. 1991). This fact that these are different can be shown by varying
the problem so that these two probabilities have different numeric
values. For example, assume the contestant knows that Monty does not
pick the second door randomly among all legal alternatives but
instead, when given an opportunity to pick between two losing doors,
Monty will open the one on the right. In this situation the following
two questions have different answers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of winning the car by always switching?
\item What is the probability of winning the car given the player has
  picked door~1 and the host has opened door~3?
\end{enumerate}


The answer to the first question is \sfrac{2}{3}, as is correctly
shown by the \enquote{simple} solutions. But the answer to the second
question is now different: the conditional probability the car is
behind door~1 or door~2 given the host has opened door 3 (the door on
the right) is \sfrac{1}{2}. This is because Monty's preference for
rightmost doors means he opens door 3 if the car is behind door~1
(which it is originally with probability \sfrac{1}{3}) or if the car
is behind door~2 (also originally with probability \sfrac{1}{3}). For
this variation, the two questions yield different answers. However as
long as the initial probability the car is behind each door is
\sfrac{1}{3}, it is never to the contestant's disadvantage to switch,
as the conditional probability of winning by switching is always at
least \sfrac{1}{2}. (Morgan et al. 1991)

There is disagreement in the literature regarding whether \textsc{vos
  Savant}'s formulation of the problem, as presented in Parade
magazine, is asking the first or second question, and whether this
difference is significant (Rosenhouse 2009). \textsc{Behrends} (2008)
concludes that \enquote{One must consider the matter with care to see
  that both analyses are correct}; which is not to say that they are
the same. One analysis for one question, another analysis for the
other question. Several discussants of the paper by (Morgan et
al. 1991), whose contributions were published alongside the original
paper, strongly criticized the authors for altering \textsc{vos
  Savant}'s wording and misinterpreting her intention (Rosenhouse
2009). One discussant (\textsc{William Bell}) considered it a matter
of taste whether or not one explicitly mentions that (under the
standard conditions), which door is opened by the host is independent
of whether or not one should want to switch.

Among the simple solutions, the \enquote{combined doors solution}
comes closest to a conditional solution, as we saw in the discussion
of approaches using the concept of odds and \textsc{Bayes} theorem. It
is based on the deeply rooted intuition that revealing information
that is already known does not affect probabilities. But knowing the
host can open one of the two unchosen doors to show a goat does not
mean that opening a specific door would not affect the probability
that the car is behind the initially chosen door. The point is, though
we know in advance that the host will open a door and reveal a goat,
we do not know which door he will open. If the host chooses uniformly
at random between doors hiding a goat (as is the case in the standard
interpretation) this probability indeed remains unchanged, but if the
host can choose non-randomly between such doors then the specific door
that the host opens reveals additional information. The host can
always open a door revealing a goat and (in the standard
interpretation of the problem) the probability that the car is behind
the initially chosen door does not change, but it is not because of
the former that the latter is true. Solutions based on the assertion
that the host's actions cannot affect the probability that the car is
behind the initially chosen appear persuasive, but the assertion is
simply untrue unless each of the host's two choices are equally
likely, if he has a choice (Falk 1992:207,213). The assertion
therefore needs to be justified; without justification being given,
the solution is at best incomplete. The answer can be correct but the
reasoning used to justify it is defective.

Some of the confusion in the literature undoubtedly arises because the
writers are using different concepts of probability, in particular,
Bayesian versus frequentist probability. For the Bayesian, probability
represents knowledge. For us and for the player, the car is initially
equally likely to be behind each of the three doors because we know
absolutely nothing about how the organizers of the show decided where
to place it. For us and for the player, the host is equally likely to
make either choice (when he has one) because we know absolutely
nothing about how he makes his choice. These \enquote{equally likely}
probability assignments are determined by symmetries in the
problem. The same symmetry can be used to argue in advance that
specific door numbers are irrelevant, as we saw above.

\chapter{Variants}
\label{sec:variants}


A common variant of the problem, assumed by several academic authors
as the canonical problem, does not make the simplifying assumption
that the host must uniformly choose the door to open, but instead that
he uses some other strategy. The confusion as to which formalization
is authoritative has led to considerable acrimony, particularly
because this variant makes proofs more involved without altering the
optimality of the always-switch strategy for the player. In this
variant, the player can have different probabilities of winning
depending on the observed choice of the host, but in any case the
probability of winning by switching is at least \sfrac{1}{2} (and can
be as high as 1), while the overall probability of winning by
switching is still exactly \sfrac{2}{3}. The variants are sometimes
presented in succession in textbooks and articles intended to teach
the basics of probability theory and game theory. A considerable
number of other generalizations have also been studied.

\section{Other host behaviors}
\label{sec:other-host-behaviors}


The version of the Monty Hall problem published in Parade in 1990 did
not specifically state that the host would always open another door,
or always offer a choice to switch, or even never open the door
revealing the car. However, \textsc{vos Savant} made it clear in her
second follow-up column that the intended host's behavior could only
be what led to the \sfrac{2}{3} probability she gave as her original
answer. \enquote{Anything else is a different question}. (vos Savant
1991a) \enquote{Virtually all of my critics understood the intended
  scenario. I personally read nearly three thousand letters (out of
  the many additional thousands that arrived) and found nearly every
  one insisting simply that because two options remained (or an
  equivalent error), the chances were even. Very few raised questions
  about ambiguity, and the letters actually published in the column
  were not among those few.} (vos Savant 1996) The answer follows if
the car is placed randomly behind any door, the host must open a door
revealing a goat regardless of the player's initial choice and, if two
doors are available, chooses which one to open randomly (Mueser and
Granberg, 1999). The table below shows a variety of other possible
host behaviors and the impact on the success of switching.

Determining the player's best strategy within a given set of other
rules the host must follow is the type of problem studied in game
theory. For example, if the host is not required to make the offer to
switch the player may suspect the host is malicious and makes the
offers more often if the player has initially selected the car. In
general, the answer to this sort of question depends on the specific
assumptions made about the host's behaviour, and might range from
\enquote{ignore the host completely} to \enquote{toss a coin and
  switch if it comes up heads}; see the last row of the table below.

Morgan et al. (1991) and Gillman (1992) both show a more general
solution where the car is (uniformly) randomly placed but the host is
not constrained to pick uniformly randomly if the player has initially
selected the car, which is how they both interpret the statement of
the problem in Parade despite the author's disclaimers. Both changed
the wording of the Parade version to emphasize that point when they
restated the problem. They consider a scenario where the host chooses
between revealing two goats with a preference expressed as a
probability~$q$, having a value between 0 and 1. If the host picks
randomly q would be \sfrac{1}{2} and switching wins with probability
\sfrac{2}{3} regardless of which door the host opens. If the player
picks door~1 and the host's preference for door~3 is $q$, then the
probability the host opens door~3 and the car is behind door~2 is
\sfrac{1}{3} while the probability the opens door~3 and the car is
behind door~1 is $(\sfrac{1}{3})q$. These are the only cases where the
host opens door~3, so the conditional probability of winning by
switching given the host opens door~3 is $\sfrac{\sfrac{1}{3}}{(\sfrac{1}{3}
+ (\sfrac{1}{3})q)}$ which simplifies to $\sfrac{1}{(1+q)}$. Since $q$
can vary between 0 and 1 this conditional probability can vary between
\sfrac{1}{2} and 1. This means even without constraining the host to
pick randomly if the player initially selects the car, the player is
never worse off switching. However neither source suggests the player
knows what the value of $q$ is so the player cannot attribute a
probability other than the \sfrac{2}{3} that \textsc{vos Savant}
assumed was implicit.

    closed door. With his strategy, the player has a win-chance of at
    least \sfrac{2}{3}, however the TV station plays; with the TV
    station's strategy, the TV station will lose with probability at
    most \sfrac{2}{3}, however the player plays. The fact that these

\section{\texorpdfstring{$N$}{N} doors}
\label{sec:n-doors}



\textsc{D.\,L.\,Ferguson} (1975 in a letter to \textsc{Selvin} cited
in \footcite{selvin1975ii}) suggests an $N$-door generalization of the original
problem in which the host opens $p$ losing doors and then offers the
player the opportunity to switch; in this variant switching wins with
probability $\sfrac{(N-1)}{N(N-p-1)}$. If the host opens even a single
door, the player is better off switching, but, if the host opens only
one door, the advantage approaches zero as $N$ grows large (Granberg
1996:188). At the other extreme, if the host opens all but one losing
door the advantage increases as $N$ grows large (the probability of
winning by switching approaches $1$ as $N$ grows very large).

\section{Quantum version}
\label{sec:quantum-version}



A quantum version of the paradox illustrates some points about the
relation between classical or non-quantum information and quantum
information, as encoded in the states of quantum mechanical
systems. The formulation is loosely based on quantum game theory. The
three doors are replaced by a quantum system allowing three
alternatives; opening a door and looking behind it is translated as
making a particular measurement. The rules can be stated in this
language, and once again the choice for the player is to stick with
the initial choice, or change to another \enquote{orthogonal}
option. The latter strategy turns out to double the chances, just as
in the classical case. However, if the show host has not randomized
the position of the prize in a fully quantum mechanical way, the
player can do even better, and can sometimes even win the prize with
certainty (Flitney and Abbott 2002, D'Ariano et al. 2002).

\chapter{History}
\label{sec:history}



The earliest of several probability puzzles related to the Monty Hall
problem is \textsc{Bertrand}'s box paradox, posed by \textsc{Joseph
  Bertrand} in 1889 in his Calcul des probabilités (Barbeau 1993). In
this puzzle there are three boxes: a box containing two gold coins, a
box with two silver coins, and a box with one of each. After choosing
a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random that happens to be
a gold coin, the question is what is the probability that the other
coin is gold. As in the Monty Hall problem the intuitive answer is
\sfrac{1}{2}, but the probability is actually \sfrac{2}{3}.

The Three Prisoners problem, published in \textsc{Martin Gardner}'s
Mathematical Games column in Scientific American in 1959 (1959a,
1959b), is equivalent to the Monty Hall problem. This problem involves
three condemned prisoners, a random one of whom has been secretly
chosen to be pardoned. One of the prisoners begs the warden to tell
him the name of one of the others who will be executed, arguing that
this reveals no information about his own fate but increases his
chances of being pardoned from \sfrac{1}{3} to \sfrac{1}{2}. The
warden obliges, (secretly) flipping a coin to decide which name to
provide if the prisoner who is asking is the one being pardoned. The
question is whether knowing the warden's answer changes the prisoner's
chances of being pardoned. This problem is equivalent to the Monty
Hall problem; the prisoner asking the question still has a
\sfrac{1}{3} chance of being pardoned but his unnamed colleague has a
\sfrac{2}{3} chance.

\textsc{Steve Selvin} posed the Monty Hall problem in a pair of
letters to the American Statistician in 1975 \footcite{selvin1975},
\footcite{selvin1975ii}. The first letter presented the problem in a
version close to its presentation in Parade~15 years later. The second
appears to be the first use of the term \enquote{Monty Hall
  problem}. The problem is actually an extrapolation from the game
show. Monty Hall did open a wrong door to build excitement, but
offered a known lesser prize – such as \$\,100 cash – rather than a
choice to switch doors. As \textsc{Monty Hall} wrote to
\textsc{Selvin}:

\begin{quote}
  And if you ever get on my show, the rules hold fast for you – no
  trading boxes after the selection.
\hfill{\textsc{Hall} 1975}
\end{quote}


A version of the problem very similar to the one that appeared three
years later in Parade was published in 1987 in the Puzzles section of
The Journal of Economic Perspectives (Nalebuff
1987). \textsc{Nalebuff}, as later writers in mathematical economics,
sees the problem as a simple and amusing exercise in game theory.

\textsc{Phillip Martin}'s article in a 1989 issue of Bridge Today
magazine titled \enquote{The Monty Hall Trap} (Martin 1989) presented
\textsc{Selvin}'s problem as an example of what \textsc{Martin} calls
the probability trap of treating non-random information as if it were
random, and relates this to concepts in the game of bridge.

A restated version of \textsc{Selvin}'s problem appeared in
\textsc{Marilyn vos Savant}'s Ask Marilyn question-and-answer column
of Parade in September 1990. \footcite{savant1990} Though \textsc{vos
  Savant} gave the correct answer that switching would win two-thirds
of the time, she estimates the magazine received \num{10000}~letters
including close to \num{1000} signed by PhDs, many on letterheads of
mathematics and science departments, declaring that her solution was
wrong. (Tierney 1991) Due to the overwhelming response, Parade
published an unprecedented four columns on the problem. (vos Savant
1996, p. xv) As a result of the publicity the problem earned the
alternative name Marilyn and the Goats.

In November 1990, an equally contentious discussion of \textsc{vos
  Savant}'s article took place in \textsc{Cecil Adams}'s column The
Straight Dope (Adams 1990). \textsc{Adams} initially answered,
incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be
one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of
\textsc{Adams}'s analysis, \textsc{Adams} agreed that mathematically,
he had been wrong, but said that the Parade version left critical
constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of
winning by switching were not necessarily \sfrac{2}{3}. Numerous
readers, however, wrote in to claim that \textsc{Adams} had been
\enquote{right the first time} and that the correct chances were one
in two.

The Parade column and its response received considerable attention in
the press, including a front page story in the New York Times in which
\textsc{Monty Hall} himself was interviewed. (Tierney 1991)
\textsc{Hall} appeared to understand the problem, giving the reporter
a demonstration with car keys and explaining how actual game play on
Let's Make a Deal differed from the rules of the puzzle.

\section{Recent discussion}
\label{sec:recent-discussion}



Over 75~papers have been published about this problem in academic
journals and the popular press. Barbeau 2000 contains a survey of the
academic literature pertaining to the Monty Hall problem and other
closely related problems as of the year 2000, and contains citations
to 40~publications on the problem. At present the book Rosenhouse 2009
has the most recent comprehensive academic survey, and refers to at
least 25~publications on the topic which appeared subsequently to
Barbeau's book. Since then another 10 or so publications have come
out. Nowadays, Wikipedia is frequently cited as a source for Monty
Hall problem (it is cited, for instance, by Ruma Falk, Rosenhouse
2009, Gill 2012, Gnedin 2012).

The problem continues to appear in many venues:

\begin{itemize}
\item The syndicated NPR program Car Talk featured it as one of their
  weekly \enquote{Puzzlers}, and the answer they featured was quite
  clearly explained as the correct one (Magliozzi and Magliozzi,
  1998).
\item Accounts of the Hungarian mathematician \textsc{Paul Erdős}'s
  first encounter of the problem can be found in The Man Who Loved
  Only Numbers and Vazsonyi 1999; like so many others, \textsc{Erdős}
  initially got it wrong.

\item The problem is presented in fictional form in the first chapter
  of the novel Mr Mee (2000) by \textsc{Andrew Crumey}.
\item  The problem is discussed, from the perspective of a boy with
  Asperger syndrome, in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the
  Night-Time, a 2003 novel by \textsc{Mark Haddon}.
\item The problem is also addressed in a lecture by the character
  \textsc{Charlie Eppes} in an episode of the CBS drama NUMB3RS
  (Episode 1.13).
\item \textsc{Derren Brown} explains the Monty Hall problem in his
  stage show Svengali. (Frost 2012) After asking a member of the
  audience to choose the location of his shoe from three boxes, he
  reveals an empty box from one of the ones not chosen. He then asks
  if they would like to change their mind and recommends that they do
  so, as it will increase their chances of winning. He explains this
  further by demonstrating on a large screen the same puzzle but with
  one hundred boxes. The member of the audience decides to stick with
  their decision and loses. The problem is also addressed in his 2006
  book Tricks Of The Mind.
\item The problem is featured in \textsc{Ian McEwan}'s 2012 novel
  Sweet Tooth.
\item \textsc{Penn Jillette} explained the Monty Hall Problem on the
  \enquote{Luck} episode of \textsc{Bob Dylan}'s Theme Time Radio Hour
  radio series.
\item The Monty Hall problem appears in the film 21 (Bloch 2008).
\item Economist \textsc{M.\,Keith Chen} identified a potential flaw in
  hundreds of experiments related to cognitive dissonance that use an
  analysis with issues similar to those involved in the Monty Hall
  problem. (Tierney 2008)
\item In 2009 a book-length discussion of the problem, its history,
  methods of solution, and variations, was published by Oxford
  University Press (Rosenhouse 2009).
\item The problem is presented, discussed, and tested in the
  television show MythBusters on 23 November 2011. This paradox was
  not only tested to see if there was an advantage to switching
  vs. sticking (which, in a repeated sample of 49 \enquote{tests},
  showed a significant advantage to switching), but they also tested
  the behavior of \enquote{contestants} presented with the same
  situation. All 20 of the common \enquote{contestants} tested chose
  to stay with their original choice.
\item The problem was also discussed and tested on the television show
  \textsc{James May}'s Man Lab on 11 April 2013. In this presentation,
  each test was done by presenting three identical beer cans, two of
  which had been shaken (with the result that opening it would douse
  the person in beer foam). \textsc{James May} performed this test
  100~times, each time switching his choice from his original choice
  after one of the shaken cans was removed. In the end, he was doused
  40~times, while his colleague Sim, who had to pick the remaining
  beer can, was doused 60~times. The resulting percentage was roughly
  what they expected, but the explanation \textsc{James May} gave was
  not correct.[citation needed]
\item \textsc{Craig Whitaker}'s actual letter to \textsc{vos Savant}
  has been found, and his original question reported in Morgan et
  al. Response to Hogbin and Nijdam (2011): \enquote{I’ve worked out
    two different situations (based on Monty’s prior behavior
    i.e. weather [sic.] or not he knows what’s behind the doors) in
    one situation it is to your advantage to switch, in the other
    there is no advantage to switch.} \enquote{What do you think?}
